    "In today’s digital world, huge amounts of text are created every moment — from news and social media to customer feedback and research articles. `Topic Modelling` is a technique that identify and extract topics from a collection of texts or documents. It is an `unsupervised NLP technique` that automatically discovers hidden themes or topics within a large collection of documents. This allows us to understand the main ideas in big text datasets without reading everything manually."

    "Topic Modeling has a wide raneg of use cases in regards to NLP, such as document tagging, social media monitoring, news categorization, amongst others. It utilizes unsupervised learning techniques, making it a very cost-effective that reduces resources required to collect human-annotated data. It answers the question: \"What is this text collection about?\" without requiring any labeled data. Upon identifying its patterns within the collection of texts, topic modeling can group words into clusters -*topics*- that frequently appear together. These topics then helps us understand the text data's main theme."

    "# Key Topic Modeling Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**\n",
    "   - LDA is a probabilistic generative model for documents. it assumes:\n",
    "     * Each Document is a mixture of topics\n",
    "     * Each topic is a probability distribution over words\n",
    "   - It aims to find the distribution of topics in each document and the distribution of words in each topic.\n",
    "   - Basically, it figures out:\n",
    "     - Which topics belong to each document\n",
    "     - Which words belong to each topic<br><br>\n",
    "   * If many documents contain \"game\", \"score\", \"team\", it might form a Sports topic.\n",
    "2. **Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)**:\n",
    "   - Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a method for topic modeling that works by taking the document-term matrix (which shows the frequency of words in documents) and breaking it down, or decomposing it, into two smaller matrices.\n",
    "   - ***In simpler terms, NMF is a math-based method that breaks down the document-word table into two smaller tables***\n",
    "     * One table shows topics and the words that describe them.\n",
    "     * The other table shows how much each document belongs to each topic.<br><br>\n",
    "3. **Latent Semantic Analysis/Latent Semantic Indexing (LSA/LSI)**\n",
    "   - LSA is a technique that uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to simplify the term-document matrix. <br>\n",
    "     This process reduces the original high-dimensional data into a smaller, \"latent semantic space.\" In this reduced space, the model identifies and captures the underlying relationships (co-occurrence patterns) between words and documents.<br>\n",
    "     The result is that documents that are positioned close together in this new low-dimensional space are considered to be related because they share similar underlying topics or concepts.\n",
    "   - You can think of it as:\n",
    "        * Compressing the text data,\n",
    "        * Keeping only the most important patterns,\n",
    "        * Removing noise or unimportant details.\n",
    "   - If two documents talk about similar ideas, LSA places them near each other even if they don’t share exact words."

    "# Use Cases of Topic Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <b><u>Customer Feedback Analysis</u></b>\n",
    "    - Companies receive thousands of reviews, survey responses, and complaints.<br>\n",
    "    Topic modeling helps group them into themes such as delivery issues, product quality, pricing concerns, etc., allowing businesses to understand customer pain points quickly.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. <b><u>Social Media Monitoring</u></b>\n",
    "    - Brands can analyze tweets, posts, or comments to detect trending topics — for example, what users are saying about a product launch or a public event.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. <b><u>Research & Academic Paper Analysis</u></b>\n",
    "    - Researchers can process thousands of scientific papers and group them into topics such as machine learning, climate change, genomics, etc., making literature review much easier.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. <b><u>News Categorization</u></b>\n",
    "    - News organizations can automatically organize articles into topics like politics, sports, technology, or entertainment without manual labeling.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. <b><u>Improving Search Engines</u></b>\n",
    "    - Search engines can identify the themes in documents, improving search relevance by showing results based on topics instead of just keywords.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "6. <b><u>Document Summarization</u></b>\n",
    "    - Topic modeling can highlight the main themes of long reports, making it easier to summarize and understand the content.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "7. <b><u>Recommender Systems</u></b>\n",
    "    - Platforms like YouTube, Netflix, or e-commerce stores can recommend items based on topics extracted from user behavior or descriptions of products.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "8. <b><u>Fraud Detection in Text</u></b>\n",
    "    - Banks and insurance companies can detect unusual patterns or topics in large collections of written claims, reports, or emails.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "9. <b><u>Healthcare & Clinical Notes Analysis</u></b>\n",
    "    - Hospitals can analyze doctor’s notes to identify recurring themes like symptoms, diagnoses, or medications to improve patient care.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "10. <b><u>Legal Document Organization</u></b>\n",
    "    - Law firms can scan thousands of case files and automatically cluster them by topics like contracts, intellectual property, or criminal cases.<br><br>"
